Expecting a home to be fun is not frivolous. It contributes greatly to happiness. 
My parents moved from new, but cookie-cutter houses every six years, five times, 
until it dawned on them to bring the key ingredients, the water, the fun, of their 
vacations home. They stayed 28 years. Happily!

A quick profile test of who likely won't like the house is with two images from a 
James Bond movie. Notice his shoes don't hold sand, etc. And in the Bahamian 
hotel he's staying at, notice all of the French doors and ceiling fans. It doesn't 
mean you're not a good person, at all, if you don't fly to warm weather vacations, stay at 
resorts such as this one and wear certain types of shoes. Just letting you know that 
this isn't your type of house.

So can this under $200k residential Lake House take on a multi-million dollar commercial 
vacation Resort? Let's try the 3:25 minute youtube video titled, "Turneffe Island Lodge 
is the Gateway to the Best of Belize". Not picking on this Resort. Any similar Resort 
would've sufficed.
<br><br>
The Resort's 7 night combo package including snorkeling, scuba, fishing, villa upgrade, 
plus tax and airfare for double-occupancy comes to $16,000 for 1 week. This Lake House 
has the Resort's activities and costs less for 1 year. Why just visit it, when you can 
live it, year round.

The Resort's video screen shots are on the right and are sequential. The video starts 
with an aerial shot of a boat on the ocean. On the left is a shot off the bow of the 
pontoon boat that comes with the Lake House. Are both beautiful? There's another pontoon 
boat out on the lake straight ahead and the Goodyear blimp flying above. Blimps, small 
airplanes and hot air balloons frequently fly over the lake, because there's something 
to see. The Ravenna Balloon Affair flying over the lake is a site.

The Resort's commercial dock and the Lake House's residential dock. Are both fun? Most 
people know that oceans' have tides, but don't know that lakes can go up or down many 
feet from year to year. That's the reason for barrels under the dock versus posts. You 
don't have to climb up or down from the boat to the dock.
<br><br>
At Portage Trails pontoon boat rentals range from $40 to $70 per hour. At West Branch 
pontoon boats rent from $280 to $470 per day. And you still have to drive to the boat's 
location.
<br><br>
Trailering a boat is even more inconvenient. It takes the spontaneous fun and instant 
gratification out of it. With your boat at your dock at your house, when you want to go 
boating, you're boating in literally two minutes. If you want to watch an asteroid shower 
in the middle of the night in sleeping bags on the deck then you just do it. If you want 
to go out in the rain, anchor at the sandbar to swim in the rain, you just do it. If 
dinners ready and it's too perfect out to be indoors, then take your dinners out on the 
boat. And so on. None of these effortlessly happen with boats docked miles away, let alone 
rented boats or trailered boats. These activities don't happen at the Resort either.
<br><br>
The catch? The pontoon boat has to be plugged in to recharge it. And every two years its 
three batteries need replaced at about $250. Between my parents' boating and my stopping 
over to use the boat, it went out about 125 times a year. So that works out to about $1 
per use.

The Lake House's upstairs has a separate kitchen, bathroom and room for two adults, or 
say three kids. Could be used as a mother-in-law-suite, for household help, renters, etc. 
You'd have to double-check this, but pretty sure foreign exchange students start at $900 
per month. That'd pay for the mortgage.

If you could only choose one, which would you take? Over 52 weeks at the Lake House or 1 
week at the Resort? Are both smile worthy? About sand, it is much easier to maintain than 
grass. Grass also attracts Canadian Geese. The Geese, Herrings (Flamingo like), Eagles, 
Hawks, Falcons, Mallards, Sea Gulls, Buffleheads, Hooded Mergansers, Loons, Pileated, etc. 
and even dogs and cats never use the sand as a litter box. Why not replace grass cutting 
with boating fun instead? No one has ever said, in all of recorded history, "You know all 
of the times we went boating, we should have been cutting the grass instead."

It was night out when I was doing this webpage, so I went ahead and took the Jacuzzi's 
picture anyway. You get the idea. The Jacuzzi is in the screened side porch. It's the 
residential version of the Resort's. Plenty of jets and heated. Holds two adults comfortably. 
The plumbing here and in other places, uses hoses that can freeze but don't break. No need 
to 'monitor' the plumbing in winter or on winter vacations.

The video then goes to a different angle from the water of the Resort. The Resort looks 
windy from the angle of the tree tops. There's actually a huge difference in the weather 
around the lake. This Lake House is in the middle of the west shore with a hill behind it. 
The weather/wind rarely blows toward the house, so its wind chill is about ten degrees 
warmer than say the east shore.

The Resort packed them in for scuba diving. The pontoon boat has been packed too. Like 9 or 
something. The pontoon boat is much more comfortable, by far. And you pack it when you want 
to, with who you want and do what you want. The lake is private with invited guests only.
<br><br>
The best times to scuba are when the water is clearest. Most of the time the water is clearest 
late Spring to early Summer and then again in early Fall. Sometimes its clear the whole time. 
The White Amur fish put into the lake help keep it clear.
<br><br>
Notice the boats' ladders. Most people on the Resort's boat will need to be pulled up the 
ladder from one or two people inside the boat. Almost anyone can get out of the water with 
the pontoon boat's ladder, unaided. My parents were still using the ladder while in their 
eighties.
<br><br>
As for safety, pontoon boats on small lakes are as safe as it gets. The wind never causes 
waves to get big enough on a small lake to threaten a pontoon boat. Far and away the most 
dangerous thing done on the lake is someone swimming after a floating object blowing away 
from him/her. Scenario: The float or kayak is "only" 20 feet away - he swims for it - it's 
still 20 feet away - he swims harder - now it's only 19 feet away - now the shore is much 
farther away than the blowing object - must swim harder to the object since it's closer than 
the shore - now totally exhausted far offshore with no flotation. Enter you on your pontoon 
as the hero.
<br><br>
Notice in the picture that no one is on the pontoon, the dive flags are waving, and two 
anchor ropes are coming off the bow, instead of just one.
<br><br>
Pontoon boats are easier to drive/control than smaller boats, too. Similar to it being 
easier to surf with a large board than a small one.

There are four sets of swim fins and two sets of kick fins on the boat and in the dock box. 
I prefer swim fins with goggles over masks and snorkels. Clam diving is fun. They get as big 
as 6x4 inches. There are literally tons of clams about half dollar size at the sandbar, the 
beach area, etc. 
<br><br>
The Resort shot shows a trim diver. Actually, the more weight someone has the easier it is 
to swim, making it a low impact way to exercise. And it's fun too.
<br><br>
The beach objects are mostly made of plastic, fiberglass, aluminum, etc. so that they can 
be left out year round. There's no crime in the neighborhood, so nothing gets stolen from 
the beach, dock or boat.

A wonderful aspect of the lake at this latitude is the absence of aquatic animals that can 
hurt you. In the freshwater here, the animals are afraid of you, and swim from you. As 
opposed to the ocean, where the opposite happens.
<br><br>
The snapping turtles here get pretty big, but they swim away as fast as they can once they 
see you. You'd have to intentionally go after one and corner it (somehow) for it to bite at 
you. Something like that professional animal teaser guy did. The catfish and Amurs get as 
big as 3-4 feet, but they're harmless.

This Lake's answer to the Resort's snorkeling spot is circled in red (North is left). It's

The Resort's video then shows a small catamaran sailboat. On the Lake, there's only one 
of those, but there are a lot of everything else such as in the left picture. Pontoon 
boats and sit-on-top kayaks are the most used, because they're effortlessly fun. They're 
used daily in warm weather and still often on cooler days.
<br><br>
The number of pontoon boats on the lake went from around 10 to 33 over the last decade. 
A new water trend are extra large floats, like giant swans. The bull riding one is 
fun/funny. A new land trend are a few golf carts appearing. Just a guess, those will 
multiply too. Perhaps you'll have to swap your lawn mower for a golf cart.

I regularly went down a sidestreet in Kent and this one new homeowner kept having a BBQ 
on Fridays in front of his garage. His family plus say 5 adult men visiting. The Friday 
BBQ get togethers stopped after a few weeks with only the homeowner out BBQ'ing. 
<br><br>
Sidestreet houses aren't destinations. There's nothing extraordinary to see or do. There's 
nothing wrong with guests wanting more from what they just left. 
<br><br>
The Lake House as with Resorts is a destination, because the views are extraordinary, and 
the activities aren't commonplace. I visited my parents at the Lake House a lot more often 
because I could also go boating and swimming.
<br><br>
My mom's poetry club would meet at the Lake House twice as much as any other member's house. 
Why meet at another sidestreet house or apartment without a view or anything unique to do? 
If you like having friends and family stop over ... 
<br><br>
What'd they talk about at the sidestreet BBQ? Fun things they'd done at someone else's Lake 
House.
<br><br>
Recipe for the BBQ: Troll fish the pontoon boat to the sand bar. Wade and rake some clams. 
Troll back. Heat some clam chowder. Grill the clams. Add the clams to the clam chowder. 
Grill the fish and cut a pineapple. Viola! Or just order a pizza delivered to the dock.

Both fly fishing shots are from the Resort's video. There's one fly fishing rod, two trolling 
rods and two casting rods on the pontoon boat. The sandbar and the bow of the pontoon are 
perfect for fly fishing. With trolling or casting, a large lure can be used so the fish 
doesn't swallow it. Fly fishing lures are small and the lure often gets swallowed. 
<br><br>
Trolling is the most entertaining for boat guests since the bass (most often) jump out of 
the water 2-3 times while being reeled in.
<br><br>
Fish, mostly bluegill, can be trained to feed at the dock, 50 plus at a time. If a bass is 
living under the dock, it'll even eat out of your fingers. That can hurt a little though.

There aren't many pools around the lake because it's freshwater not saltwater. If you want 
to swim you've already got a giant maintenance free "pool". If you can't swim or not too well, 
grab a float and a life vest.
<br><br>
Ocean Resorts have pools so guests have carefree water. In the ocean you always have to be 
alert. In a pool or on the lake you can fall asleep on a lounge float without concern. No 
one does that on the ocean.
<br><br>
My two favorite water activities, with the music up, are tethering lounge floats to the boat, 
to float across the lake and bodyboarding with fins.

Primarily in the Summer, the street becomes promenade light, with walkers, joggers,

The Resort's outdoor bar and the Lake House's 'juice bar'. The juice bar is countertop 
height instead of bar height, so as not to block the view of the lake. There are some 
intentionally retro designs in the house, such as the yellow sink and the tiled countertop

the common stone and steel.

So, which would you rather have? 1 week at the Resort or over 1 year at the Lake House?

Everyone in my immediate family has a Lake House for that reason. Everything in the Resort's

The last house sold on Westshore Drive, on the lake with a beach, a dock and a boat was 6436 
Westshore, pictured here, on June 21, 2016. The reason the owners sold it was because they 
moved a bigger house to another lot on the lake where they also have a beach, a dock and a 
boat. 
<br><br>
The reason they stayed on the lake, my parent's staying 28 years and the lack of comparables 
is because once someone moves onto the lake, they stay. They/we/you have got the house and 
a permanent vacation Resort environment. Where's this better place to move to? 
<br><br>
If a house doesn't have an unobstructed view of the lake and full access with its own beach, 
it's not a comparable. It's just another sidestreet house without the Resort's features. 
Would you go to the Resort without its view and fun activities just for the bungalow? Why buy 
a house without those fun activities, the lifestyle?
<br><br>
If your realtor maintains that a sidestreet house is comparable to a Lake House, then why 
would someone move a house from a sidestreet a mile away to make it a Lake House?

The pictured house sold for $133,000, has 2 beds, 1 bath and 826 square feet. Online estimates 
of its current price range from $82,779 to $134,295. So it sold for $161 per square foot 
(in reality) while its current estimates range from $100 to $163 per square foot.
<br><br>
This Lake House has 3 beds, 4 baths, 2,037 square feet, screened in side porch and full 
basement. Using the square foot price range above, that puts the Lake House's price between 
$203,700 and $332,031. Using the charts median $88 per square foot, which includes sidestreet 
houses, the Lake House's price is around $179,256.
<br><br>
As to the graph, the Lake House is being cleared out of any remaining clutter, primarily in 
the basement. The inside needs a thorough cleaning. And then the inside and out need a fresh 
coat of paint. This will be done by Spring. When the trees are green and the boats are on the 
lake, this Lake House will hit its peak appeal. Note, that the pictured house sold in June. 
So, do you risk waiting until everything is beautiful?

This under $200k Lake House looks a lot more like a million dollar plus house on Martha's 
Vineyard than the small house shown previously. What do you think?
<br><br>
As with Martha's Vineyard there isn't any realistic threat to housing values. KSU is the 
city's anchor tenant and won't be going out of business, such as a city dependent upon 
say an auto manufacturer.

These images only show about one third of the Lake House's panoramic view. What's out the 
windows where you are now? What's out the windows of the other houses you're looking at? 
Do you smile when you look out? (click to enlarge)
